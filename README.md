I am currently creating a wedding invitation for a couple of groom and bride
as a freelancer, this is being done with html, css and js.

During my previous position at Marmat and Centro Diurno de Ancianos 
Hatillo-San SebastiÃ¡n, I had the opportunity to develop a full stack web
application going through all the processes of the software development 
cycle. 

This experience has honed my ability to deliver high quality code and meet 
tight deadlines.
